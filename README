About
==================
Selenium is great for unit testing, but not so great for scraping. A lot of
times, you need to access invisible elements, run javascript, load jquery, and
have a much friendlier/evented way of interacting with a site -- This is it.

Install
==================
Just check out the project, and run ant dist. It should generate it's ivy artifact in the ./dist folder. Also, it will install into your ivy cache.

Using as a Library
==================
After installing, you can reference it as an ivy library as it will be in your
ivy cache -- Check the ./dist/ivy.xml to see what the org, module, and rev should be set to!

Requirements
==================
The only requirement is ant, as everything else should be pulled in by ant.
